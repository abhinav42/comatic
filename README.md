comatic
=======

comatic is a python based Static webcomic generator.
It is based on the xkcd style of comic management for now.

Dependencies: Jenja2

It will power hopefully my webcomic that used to run on comicpress one day. :')

This is a weekend hack. If you end up using it, let me know! I'll be glad to fix up stuff!
